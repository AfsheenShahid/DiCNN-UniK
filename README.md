# 🦠 DiCNN-UniK: Dual-Input CNN  based on Universal and Unique K-mer librariesfor Viral Sequence Classification

## Accurate Flavivirus Classification via Unique and Universal k-mer Embeddings



## 🚀 Simple Overview

**DiCNN-UniK** is a novel deep learning model for **highly accurate and robust classification of viral sequences**, specifically focused on **Flaviviruses**.

We developed this Dual-Input CNN (DiCNN) to overcome the major limitations of traditional bioinformatics methods (like Multiple Sequence Alignment, MSA) which struggle with incomplete or poor-quality genomic data.

### Key Highlights:
* **UniK Advantage:** We generate novel, direct embeddings using **unique and universal k-mer libraries**, providing a clear "picture" of the local genomic context instead of relying on simple frequency counts.
* **Full Genome Support:** The model is trained and runs on **full-length genomic sequences**, bypassing the restrictive length limits of many modern models.
* **Superior Performance:** Achieves an impressive **99% accuracy** on Flavivirus classification.
* **Real-World Ready:** Highly robust and reliable, maintaining high performance at **95% accuracy** even with genomic coverage as low as **20%**.
